# Desalination Code

This repository contains code for plotting word counts, elevations, salt buildup, anion concentrations, and cation concentrations.

## Usage

To use the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

* matplotlib
* numpy
* collections

Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the code by running the following command:

python
python desalination_code.py
```

## Output

The code will generate the following plots:

* A bar plot of the word counts for two texts.
* A line plot of the elevations of five runs.
* A line plot of the salt buildup after a year of running the desalination plant.
* A line plot of the anion concentrations over time.
* A line plot of the cation concentrations over time.
