# Environmental Impacts of Brine Discharge from Desalination Plants

This repository contains code for creating a pie chart that shows the percentage of environmental impacts of brine discharge from desalination plants.

## Usage

To use the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

* matplotlib
* numpy

Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the code by running the following command:

python
python brine_discharge_pie_chart.py


## Output

The code will generate a pie chart that shows the following percentages:

* Increased salinity: 50%
* Decreased oxygen levels: 20%
* Introduction of pollutants: 30%

The pie chart will also show a combined text label that shows the total percentage of environmental impacts and some additional text.
